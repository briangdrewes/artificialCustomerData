# artificialCustomerData
Interesting concept for companies that create technical assessments for applicants. Very shallow personalization in this case but the idea is to curate an entire data set based on the features or behaviors of your current data &amp; customers.

A good flow for viewing is 'artificialDataGeneration' -> 'segmentAnalysis' -> 'customerChurnML' or 'kMeansClassification'
